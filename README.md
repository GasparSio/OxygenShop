# OXYGENShop
**OXYGENShop** is the first project I made at OXYGEN Academy. It is a landing page for a shop that does not exist. 

### Tech used
`HTML, CSS, SASS, BEM, JAVASCRIPT`

### Key functionalities:
- Progress bar that fills up as the web page scrolls down.
- Back to top button that appears when the user scrolls down, and this button takes you back to the top.
- Form validation and posting data to an external API.
- A modal to subscribe the newsletter. It shows five seconds after page load or if the user scrolls down more than 25%. Once the modal opens it gets stored in Local Storage and it will not show again when the user visits the website again.
- Currency converter that takes the todayÂ´s exchange rates from an external API.
- An image slider that slides by clicking on the arrows or on the dots.
